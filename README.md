# Introduction-to-AI-Project1
Project instructions and starting code for the first project of the course `Introduction to AI` @ UniTs.

Here is the first project due to the November 23th. In the pdf you will find the instructions. The `search` folder contains all the .py you will need to make the whole project run. As is written in the instructions, you should modify just some files, other ones must be ignored. You can read all of them to get an idea on how the whole pipeline works but is not required.
